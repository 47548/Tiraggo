=======

<img src="https://raw.github.com/BrewDawg/Tiraggo/images/platforms.png" border="0">

A C# Cross Platform ORM Architecture derived from EntitySpaces with full (Xamarin Mono Touch Support) (http://xamarin.com/)
(MonoTouch Support)

##Support Thus Far##
* The Templates on https://www.My2ndGeneration.com for Tiraggo now generate clean code from your database schema
* There is a windows Sample Application in the Samples folder (cheesy but just a test app for now)
* The MonoTouch iPhone/iPad .iOS projects compile clean (sample app due within days)

Next up, Android, should be done by this weekend ...
