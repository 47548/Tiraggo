Tiraggo
=======

A C# Cross Platform ORM Architecture derived from EntitySpaces (MonoTouch Support)

##Support Thus Far##
* The Templates on https://www.My2ndGeneration.com for Tiraggo now generate clean code from your database schema
* There is a windows Sample Application in the Samples folder (cheesy but just a test app for now)
* The MonoTouch iPhone/iPad .iOS project compile clean (sample app due within days)

Next up, Android, should be done by this weekend
